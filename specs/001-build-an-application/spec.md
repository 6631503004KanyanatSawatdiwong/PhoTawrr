# Feature Specification: Photo Album Organization Application

**Branch**: `main`  
**Created**: 20 September 2025  
**Status**: Approved  
**Feature ID**: 001-build-an-application  
**Input**: User description: "build an application that can help me organise my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organised by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description successfully parsed
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: photo organization, albums by date, drag-and-drop, tile interface
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow clearly defined around photo organization
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## System Context

### Overview
PhoTawrr is a photo organization application designed to help users manage their personal photo collections through an intuitive, date-based album system. The application provides a clean, user-friendly interface for viewing and organizing photos without the complexity of nested folder structures.

### Target Users
- Individual users with personal photo collections
- Users who want simple, automated photo organization
- Users who prefer visual, drag-and-drop interfaces over complex folder hierarchies

### System Boundaries
- **In Scope**: Photo import, automatic date-based grouping, album reordering, tile-based photo viewing
- **Out of Scope**: Photo editing, social sharing, cloud synchronization, advanced metadata management
- **Integrations**: Local file system access for photo import and storage

### Business Context
The application addresses the common problem of photo disorganization by providing an automated, date-centric approach to photo management that reduces manual sorting effort while maintaining easy access to photos from specific time periods.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Album Organization
**As a** photo enthusiast with hundreds of photos  
**I want to** see my photos automatically organized into date-based albums  
**So that** I can quickly locate photos from specific events or time periods without manually sorting them

### User Story 2: Album Reordering
**As a** user with multiple photo albums  
**I want to** drag and drop albums to reorder them on the main page  
**So that** I can prioritize and arrange my albums according to my personal preferences and viewing habits

### User Story 3: Photo Browsing
**As a** user browsing my photo collection  
**I want to** view photos within an album in a tile-based grid layout  
**So that** I can quickly scan through multiple photos and easily select ones I want to view in detail

## Acceptance Criteria

### Album Auto-Organization
- **AC-001**: When photos are imported, they are automatically grouped into albums based on date metadata
- **AC-002**: Albums are labeled with human-readable date formats (e.g., "January 2025", "March 15, 2024")
- **AC-003**: Photos without date metadata are placed in a designated "Undated" album
- **AC-004**: Each photo belongs to exactly one album (no duplicates across albums)

### Drag-and-Drop Functionality
- **AC-005**: Albums can be dragged and dropped to new positions on the main page
- **AC-006**: Visual feedback is provided during drag operations (hover states, drop zones)
- **AC-007**: Album order changes are immediately visible and persist between application sessions
- **AC-008**: Drag-and-drop operations are smooth and responsive (no lag or glitches)

### Photo Viewing Experience
- **AC-009**: Photos within albums are displayed in a grid of tiles with consistent sizing
- **AC-010**: Tile grid automatically adjusts to window size and displays optimal number of columns
- **AC-011**: Clicking on a photo tile opens a larger, detailed view of the photo
- **AC-012**: Navigation between photos in detailed view is possible without returning to tile view
- **AC-013**: Albums with many photos load efficiently without performance degradation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when photos don't have date metadata?
- How does the system handle albums with very large numbers of photos?
- What occurs when a user tries to create nested albums (should be prevented)?
- How does the system behave when no photos are available?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
