# Implementation Plan: Photo Album Organization Application

**Branch**: `001-build-an-application` | **Date**: 20 September 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](/Users/carmenk./Documents/GitHub/PhoTawrr/specs/001-build-an-application/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-an-application/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Photo album organization application that automatically groups photos by date into albums, allows drag-and-drop reordering of albums, and displays photos in tile-based grids. Built with Vite, vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and SQLite for metadata storage without uploading images.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2022, HTML5, CSS3  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite (build tool), SQLite (via web SQL/IndexedDB), File System Access API  
**Storage**: SQLite database for metadata, local file system for photo files (no uploads)  
**Testing**: Vitest (Vite's test runner), Playwright for E2E testing  
**Target Platform**: Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with file system access  
**Project Type**: web - single-page application with local file access  
**Performance Goals**: <2s album loading (500 photos), <100ms drag response, <1s thumbnail loading  
**Constraints**: No photo uploads, no photo modification, local-only operation, minimal libraries  
**Scale/Scope**: 10,000 photos maximum, tile-based interface, date-based auto-organization

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: PASS - No active constitution to validate against (constitution.md is template)

**Validation Notes**:
- No constitutional violations identified
- Minimal dependency approach aligns with simplicity principles
- Local-only operation reduces complexity
- Vite + vanilla approach follows modern web standards

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Web application with frontend-only architecture, no backend needed due to local-only operation

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract test → contract test implementation task [P]
- Each service interface → service implementation task [P] 
- Each UI component → component implementation task
- Integration tasks to connect services
- Database setup and schema creation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Database → Models → Services → Controllers → UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)
- Critical path: Database setup → Photo/Album services → UI integration

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Task Categories**:
1. **Setup Tasks** (1-3): Database schema, project structure, dependencies
2. **Contract Test Tasks** (4-9): PhotoService, AlbumService, UIController tests [P]
3. **Model Implementation** (10-12): Photo, Album, UserPreferences models [P]
4. **Service Implementation** (13-18): Database, Photo, Album services
5. **UI Implementation** (19-25): Controllers, components, drag-drop
6. **Integration Tasks** (26-30): Service connections, event handling
7. **Validation Tasks** (31-35): Performance testing, cross-browser validation

**Parallel Execution Groups**:
- Contract tests can run in parallel (independent)
- Model implementations are independent
- UI components can be developed in parallel
- Service implementations depend on models but are otherwise independent

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
