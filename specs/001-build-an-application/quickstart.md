# Quickstart Guide: Photo Album Organization Application

**Date**: 20 September 2025  
**Feature**: Photo Album Organization Application  
**Phase**: 1 - Design & Contracts

## Quick Setup & Validation

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up, run, and validate the photo album organization application.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18+ with npm
- **Modern Browser**: Chrome 86+, Firefox 90+, Safari 14+, or Edge 86+
- **Local Photos**: Sample photo files for testing (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, TIFF)

### 1. Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone repository and navigate to project
cd PhoTawrr

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Expected Result**: Development server starts on `http://localhost:5173` with live reload enabled.

### 2. Application Launch Validation

```bash
# Open browser and navigate to development URL
open http://localhost:5173
```

**Expected Result**: 
- Main page loads with empty state message "No albums yet"
- Import button is visible and functional
- No console errors in browser developer tools

### 3. Photo Import Test

**Steps**:
1. Click "Import Photos" button
2. Select 3-5 test photos from your local system
3. Confirm selection in file picker dialog

**Expected Results**:
- Loading indicator appears during import
- Photos are automatically grouped into date-based albums
- Album tiles appear on main page with photo counts
- Each album shows cover photo thumbnail

**Sample Test Data**: Use photos with different dates to create multiple albums.

### 4. Album Organization Test

**Steps**:
1. Verify albums are sorted chronologically (newest first)
2. Drag an album tile to a different position
3. Drop the album in new location
4. Refresh the page

**Expected Results**:
- Smooth drag-and-drop animation during move
- Album reorders immediately after drop
- New order persists after page refresh
- Visual feedback during drag operation (hover states)

### 5. Photo Viewing Test

**Steps**:
1. Click on an album tile to open it
2. Verify photo grid layout displays properly
3. Click on a photo tile to view larger image
4. Navigate between photos in detail view
5. Return to album grid view

**Expected Results**:
- Photos load in responsive tile grid
- Thumbnails load within 1 second
- Large photo view opens smoothly
- Navigation between photos works correctly
- Back button returns to album view

### 6. Performance Validation

**Test Scenarios**:

#### Large Album Test
- Import 50+ photos from same time period
- Verify album loads within 2 seconds
- Check smooth scrolling in photo grid

#### Multiple Albums Test  
- Create 10+ albums with varying photo counts
- Verify main page loads quickly
- Test drag-and-drop responsiveness

#### Browser Storage Test
- Add photos, reorder albums
- Close and reopen browser
- Verify all data persists correctly

### 7. Error Handling Validation

**Test Cases**:

#### Invalid File Types
1. Try importing non-image files (PDF, Word doc)
2. **Expected**: Error message displayed, import rejected

#### Corrupted Images
1. Import a damaged/corrupted image file
2. **Expected**: Graceful error handling, other photos still import

#### Storage Limits
1. Import very large photo collections (1000+ photos)
2. **Expected**: Performance warning, but application remains responsive

#### Browser Compatibility
1. Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
2. **Expected**: Core functionality works across browsers

### 8. User Experience Validation

**Usability Checklist**:
- [ ] Album names are human-readable (e.g., "January 2025")
- [ ] Photo counts are accurate and visible
- [ ] Drag-and-drop feels natural and responsive
- [ ] Loading states are clear and informative
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and non-technical
- [ ] Navigation is intuitive without instructions

### 9. Database Integrity Check

**Validation Steps**:
```bash
# Run database verification script
npm run verify-db

# Check for orphaned records
npm run check-orphans

# Validate data consistency
npm run validate-data
```

**Expected Results**:
- No orphaned photo records
- Album photo counts match actual photos
- All file paths are valid and accessible

### 10. Production Build Test

```bash
# Build production version
npm run build

# Serve production build locally
npm run preview
```

**Expected Results**:
- Build completes without errors
- Production app loads and functions identically
- Performance is equal or better than development

## Integration Test Scenarios

### User Story 1: First-Time User Experience
1. **Setup**: Fresh application with no existing data
2. **Action**: Import mixed collection of 20 photos from different dates
3. **Validation**: 
   - Multiple albums created automatically
   - Photos distributed correctly by date
   - Undated photos go to "Undated" album
   - Album order makes chronological sense

### User Story 2: Power User Workflow
1. **Setup**: Existing collection with 5+ albums
2. **Action**: Import new photos, reorder albums, browse extensively
3. **Validation**:
   - New photos integrate seamlessly
   - Album reordering is smooth and persistent
   - Application remains responsive throughout

### User Story 3: Edge Case Handling
1. **Setup**: Mix of edge cases (no EXIF data, future dates, very old photos)
2. **Action**: Import and organize problematic photos
3. **Validation**:
   - Application handles all edge cases gracefully
   - Error states are user-friendly
   - Data integrity maintained

## Performance Benchmarks

**Target Metrics**:
- Album loading: < 2 seconds for 500 photos
- Drag response: < 100ms interaction feedback
- Thumbnail generation: < 1 second per photo
- Memory usage: < 200MB for 1000 photos

**Measurement Tools**:
```bash
# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Generate performance report
npm run analyze:performance
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Import Dialog Not Appearing
- **Cause**: Browser doesn't support File System Access API
- **Solution**: Fallback file input should appear automatically

### Photos Not Grouping by Date
- **Cause**: Photos missing EXIF date metadata
- **Solution**: Photos should appear in "Undated" album

### Drag-and-Drop Not Working
- **Cause**: JavaScript error or browser compatibility
- **Solution**: Check console for errors, try different browser

### Slow Performance
- **Cause**: Large photo collections or insufficient browser resources
- **Solution**: Enable lazy loading, reduce thumbnail cache size

## Success Criteria

✅ **Application launches without errors**  
✅ **Photo import workflow completes successfully**  
✅ **Albums organize automatically by date**  
✅ **Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly**  
✅ **Photo viewing provides good user experience**  
✅ **Data persists between browser sessions**  
✅ **Performance meets specified benchmarks**  
✅ **Error handling is graceful and informative**

## Next Steps

After successful quickstart validation:

1. **Run Full Test Suite**: `npm test`
2. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize bottlenecks
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Validate on all target platforms
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Gather feedback from real users
5. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to hosting platform
